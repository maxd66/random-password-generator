## Description

This website is a random password generator that takes inputs from the user to give them a random password matching the exact specifications of their desired password. It can create passwords of length 8 characters all the way up to 128 characters, using any combination of uppercase letter, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The password is then displayed to be copied, and is ready to generate another password at the user's leisure.

## Installation and Usage

There is no installation required.

## Credits

The javascript as far as generating the new password is completely my own, however the reactivity to button click, html, and css were provided to me by the UCSD Extension coding bootcamp. 

## License

Again the html, css, and reactivity of the button all belong to UCSD Extension Coding Bootcamp.
